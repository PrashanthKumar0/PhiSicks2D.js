# PhiSicks2D.js

A 2D physics engine written in JS xD

[Demo](https://github.com)

    CAUTION:
        This is just made for fun not a serious project. 
        " all my projects are for fun :) "
        and as the name suggests its a sick engine :P
        doesnt work very well  
        
&nbsp;

    Well first ever engine made by me.
    and as its name suggests it a little buggy (not ment to be used in any practical game)

    Although its quite buggy You may use its parts like SAT-collision detection


The part which is buggy is : 
```javascript
// in
function resolveCollision();
// after the comment 
// ANCHOR : BUGGY PART
```
While every other thing in this engine is perfect. (i probably need to work on it but i am going to prepare for JEE exam so i will pause the work).
